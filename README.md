# Python_4_Data_Science
Just a set of simple examples of how to analyze data with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Stats packages in Python and Google Colab

Part of this repository was originally forked from Prof. Luke Olson [Github Repo](https://github.com/lukeolson/mse598dm-python-data) from UIUC but I decided to add more stuff and delete the previous forked project to add more examples in an independent repo.
